**Question:**
How can you prove to the client that students in higher classes are taller than those of lower classes?

**Answer:**
To summarize the answer:
- To prove that students in higher classes are taller than those in lower classes, follow these steps:
- Define higher and lower classes based on grade levels.
- Collect reliable height measurements from both groups.
- Organize the data into separate datasets.
- Calculate the average height for each group.
- Conduct a statistical test, such as a two-sample t-test, to compare the means.
- Calculate the p-value, which indicates the probability of obtaining the observed height difference if there is no real difference.
- If the p-value is below the significance level (e.g., 0.05), there is evidence to support the claim that higher-class students are taller.
- If the p-value is higher, there is not enough evidence to support the claim.

It is important to ensure accurate data collection and apply appropriate statistical methods for valid conclusions.
