# Data-Science-Projects
Data Science is primarily used to make decisions and predictions making use of predictive causal analytics, prescriptive analytics (predictive plus decision science) and machine learning.  
This repository consists of all the data science based classifiers and advanced data mining algorithms like C4.5, K-Means, SVM, Apriori, EM, PageRank, AdaBoost, kNN, Naïve Bayes, CART, etc. and the top 10 machine learning algorithms are Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Classification and Regression Trees, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Learning Vector Quantization,  Support Vector Machines, Bagging and Random Forest, Boosting and AdaBoost.
