## üß© Time-Series Models Overview

Below is a concise description of the most commonly used time-series forecasting models:

| Model | Brief Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) | A statistical model that uses past values of the time series, past forecast errors, and differencing to capture trends, seasonality (with SARIMA), and correlation. |
| **Bagged ETS** | An **ensemble method** that generates multiple forecasts using bootstrap samples of the data and then averages them. It's often applied to the ETS model. |
| **BATS** (BATS and TBATS) | A complex exponential smoothing model designed for series with **multiple seasonal patterns** (e.g., daily and yearly) that also have non-integer seasonal periods or complex seasonal patterns. |
| **CNN** (Convolutional Neural Network) | A **Deep Learning** model primarily used for image processing but adapted for time series by treating data as a 1D sequence or 2D image. Excellent at learning local patterns. |
| **Croston** | A specialized statistical method for forecasting **intermittent demand** (when demand is zero for many periods, and non-zero demand occurs randomly). |
| **ETS** (Error, Trend, Seasonality) | Also known as **Exponential Smoothing**, it assigns exponentially decreasing weights to older observations and can handle additive or multiplicative trend and seasonality. |
| **Facebook Prophet** | A flexible, automated procedure for time series forecasting by Facebook. It uses a decomposable model with components for trend, seasonality, and holidays/events. |
| **Holt-Winters** | An extension of the ETS model that explicitly includes **trend and seasonality** components. Effective for series that exhibit both. |
| **Linear SVM** (Support Vector Machine) | A machine learning model (SVR - Support Vector Regression) that finds a hyperplane best fitting the data. Linear SVR uses a linear kernel. |
| **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) | A **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** model that captures long-term dependencies and mitigates the vanishing gradient problem. Ideal for sequential data. |
| **MLP** (Multi-Layer Perceptron) | A **Neural Network** with one or more hidden layers. It‚Äôs a general-purpose function approximator for non-linear relationships. |
| **Naive** (Random Walk) | The simplest model ‚Äî the forecast for the next period is simply the **last observed value** ($\hat{y}_{t+1} = y_t$). |
| **Neural Network** | A broad term for architectures (MLP, CNN, LSTM) inspired by the human brain. They learn non-linear data relationships through interconnected nodes. |
| **Random Forest** | An **ensemble learning** method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their outputs for regression/forecasting. |
| **RWF** (Random Walk Forecast) | Another name for the **Naive** forecasting method. |
| **Seasonal Naive** | The forecast for the next period equals the value from the **same period in the last season** ($\hat{y}_{t+h} = y_{t+h-m}$, where $m$ is the seasonal period). |
| **SES** (Simple Exponential Smoothing) | A simple ETS variant used for series with **no trend or seasonality**. Smooths only the level of the series. |
| **Spline** | A non-parametric method that fits piecewise low-degree polynomials to ensure smoothness at connection points (knots). Useful for curve fitting. |
| **StructTS** (Structural Time Series) | A **State Space Model** that decomposes time series into unobserved components like trend, seasonality, and irregular components. |
| **TBATS** (Trigonometric BATS) | Extends BATS with **trigonometric terms** to model complex seasonality more flexibly. |
| **TSLM** (Time Series Linear Model) | A **Multiple Linear Regression** model using time, trend, seasonality, or external factors (e.g., price, weather) as predictors. |
| **XGBoost** (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) | A scalable **Gradient Boosting Decision Tree** model that builds trees sequentially to minimize residual errors. |

## ‚öñÔ∏è Comparative Analysis of Time-Series Models

The models can be broadly categorized into three groups:

- **Statistical / Econometric Models**
- **Machine Learning & Ensemble Models**
- **Neural Network / Deep Learning Models**

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ARIMA / SARIMA** | **Highly interpretable**; strong mathematical foundation; excellent for **linear correlations**. | Requires **stationarity**; model selection (ACF/PACF) is **labor-intensive**; struggles with non-linear patterns. | **Univariate forecasting**; economic or financial time series. |
| **ETS / Holt-Winters / SES** | **Simple, robust**, and data-efficient; handles **trend & seasonality** automatically. | Limited to specific functional forms; **weak for long-term forecasts**; cannot handle exogenous variables. | Retail demand; short-term planning; baseline comparisons. |
| **Naive / Seasonal Naive / RWF** | **Fast and simple**; excellent **benchmark models**; often surprisingly accurate for seasonal or volatile data. | **No explanatory power**; fails on trending data; too simplistic for complex patterns. | Baseline forecasts; volatile or highly seasonal data. |
| **BATS / TBATS** | Handles **multiple complex seasonalities** and non-integer periods; fully automated. | **Computationally heavy**; less interpretable; not standard in all libraries. | Hourly/daily/weekly seasonal data; long-term demand. |
| **Croston** | **Best for intermittent demand** (sporadic data). | **Not suitable** for continuous demand. | Inventory & spare parts forecasting. |
| **StructTS** | Clean decomposition via **State Space Models**; handles missing data. | Less commonly used; **complex parameter interpretation**. | Structural decomposition; smoothing/filtering. |
